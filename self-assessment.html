  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

  <p>
    Throughout the Computer Science program, I have moved beyond just editing and writing 
    code that simply functions and began thinking more carefully about structure, 
    scalability, and long-term design decisions. This capstone represents that shift. 
    The enhancements to my ABCU Advising Assistant project demonstrate growth across 
    software engineering, algorithms, database integration, and secure development practices.
  </p>

  <h3>Collaboration and Communication</h3>

  <p>
    Most of the coursework throughout the Computer Science program was completed independently, 
    but some collaboration occurred through structured discussions, instructor feedback, and 
    revision cycles. One important thing I learned was how to explain technical reasoning 
    clearly and organize documentation so that others can understand not only what a system does, 
    but also why it was designed that way.
  </p>

  <p>
    In software development lifecycle assignments, I created requirement documents, structured 
    enhancement plans, and project timelines using Agile, waterfall, and other approaches. 
    I also completed Java unit testing exercises that required systematic validation of edge 
    cases and expected outcomes. These experiences strengthened my ability to plan, test, and 
    communicate progress in a structured way.
  </p>

  <h3>Software Engineering</h3>

  <p>
    The software engineering enhancement mostly focused on restructuring the Advising Assistant 
    into a more organized and maintainable design. While the original program produced correct 
    output, it lacked clear separation between data, logic, and presentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Refactoring the program required intentional separation of responsibilities, improved 
    validation, and structured exception handling. This process shifted my focus from just 
    making a program work to making it sustainable and adaptable. I began evaluating design 
    decisions based on long-term functionality and efficiency rather than short-term convenience.
  </p>

  <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>

  <p>
    For the algorithms enhancement, I created a custom hash table using array-based indexing 
    and linked-list chaining. Designing the hash function and handling collisions made 
    performance trade-offs more visible, requiring careful reasoning and strategies for efficiency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier coursework introduced recursion, tree structures, and complexity analysis. 
    Applying those concepts in a practical implementation reinforced how algorithmic 
    decisions directly affect scalability. Building the hash table without relying on 
    standard library containers strengthened my understanding of how data structures behave internally.
  </p>

  <h3>Database Design</h3>

  <p>
    The database enhancement transformed the artifact from file-based loading to structured 
    persistence using SQLite. This required reconsidering how course data was stored, accessed, 
    and maintained beyond temporary in-memory collections.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previous database coursework involved writing SQL queries, designing schemas, and 
    modeling relationships. That foundation informed the capstone integration and 
    strengthened my understanding of how storage decisions influence clarity, scalability, 
    and maintainability within an application.
  </p>

  <h3>Security Mindset</h3>

  <p>
    Throughout the program, I developed a habit of questioning assumptions about input, 
    structure, and system boundaries. Rather than assuming ideal conditions, I began 
    planning for invalid input, unexpected behavior, bugs, security risks, and other 
    problematic occurrences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Incorporating validation and structured exception handling became part of how I 
    approach development. Even in courses where security was not the primary focus, 
    identifying potential weaknesses and documenting risks influenced how I structure 
    programs moving forward.
  </p>

  <h3>Professional Growth and Career Direction</h3>

  <p>
    Completing the program clarified that I am motivated by structured problem solving, 
    autonomy, and the ability to build systems that extend capability. I am especially 
    interested in combining strong engineering fundamentals with emerging AI-driven tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Independent projects involving automation tools, data analysis, reinforcement learning 
    experimentation, and creative software development reflect that direction. Long-term 
    professional value depends on strong foundations in algorithmic reasoning, architecture, 
    and secure design. This portfolio represents measurable progress toward those principles.
