  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

  <p>
    Throughout the Computer Science program, I moved beyond writing code that simply
    functions and began thinking more carefully about structure, scalability, and long-term
    design decisions. This capstone represents that shift. The enhancements to my ABCU
    Advising Assistant project demonstrate growth across software engineering,
    algorithms, database integration, and secure development practices.
  </p>

  <h3>Collaboration and Communication</h3>

  <p>
    Most coursework was completed independently, but meaningful collaboration occurred
    through structured discussions, instructor feedback, and revision cycles. I learned
    to explain technical reasoning clearly and to organize documentation so that others
    could understand not only what a system does, but why it was designed that way.
  </p>

  <p>
    In software development lifecycle assignments, I created requirement documents,
    structured enhancement plans, and project timelines using both Agile and waterfall
    approaches. I also completed Java unit testing exercises that required systematic
    validation of edge cases and expected outcomes. These experiences strengthened my
    ability to plan, test, and communicate progress in a structured way.
  </p>

  <h3>Software Engineering</h3>

  <p>
    The software engineering enhancement focused on restructuring the Advising Assistant
    into a more organized and maintainable design. While the original program produced
    correct output, it lacked clear separation between data, logic, and presentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Refactoring the program required intentional separation of responsibilities and
    improved validation and exception handling. This process shifted my focus from
    making a program work to making it sustainable and adaptable. I began evaluating
    design decisions based on long-term clarity rather than short-term convenience.
  </p>

  <h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>

  <p>
    For the algorithms enhancement, I implemented a custom hash table using array-based
    indexing and linked-list chaining. Designing the hash function and handling
    collisions made performance trade-offs more visible and required careful reasoning
    about efficiency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier coursework introduced recursion, tree structures, and complexity analysis.
    Applying those concepts in a practical implementation reinforced how algorithmic
    decisions directly affect scalability. Building the hash table without relying on
    standard library containers strengthened my understanding of how data structures
    behave internally.
  </p>

  <h3>Database Design</h3>

  <p>
    The database enhancement transitioned the artifact from file-based loading to
    structured persistence using SQLite. This required reconsidering how course data
    was stored, accessed, and maintained beyond temporary in-memory collections.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previous database coursework involved writing SQL queries, designing schemas,
    and modeling relationships. That foundation informed the capstone integration
    and strengthened my understanding of how storage decisions influence clarity,
    scalability, and maintainability within an application.
  </p>

  <h3>Security Mindset</h3>

  <p>
    Throughout the program, I developed a habit of questioning assumptions about input,
    structure, and system boundaries. Rather than assuming ideal conditions, I began
    planning for invalid input and unexpected behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    Incorporating validation and structured exception handling became part of how I
    approach development. Even in courses where security was not the primary focus,
    identifying potential weaknesses and documenting risks influenced how I structure
    programs moving forward.
  </p>

  <h3>Professional Growth and Career Direction</h3>

  <p>
    Completing the program clarified that I am motivated by structured problem solving,
    autonomy, and the ability to build systems that extend capability. I am especially
    interested in combining strong engineering fundamentals with emerging AI-driven tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    Independent projects involving automation tools, data analysis, reinforcement
    learning experimentation, and creative software development reflect that direction.
    Long-term professional value depends on strong foundations in algorithmic reasoning,
    architecture, and secure design. This portfolio represents measurable progress
    toward those principles.
