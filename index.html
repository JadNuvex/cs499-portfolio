    <h2>Welcome</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Jaden Knutson, and I am a Computer Science student currently 
        completing my final coursework. This ePortfolio represents the capstone 
        of my academic growth and demonstrates progression from writing functional 
        code to engineering structured, maintainable, and scalable systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        This portfolio centers on iterative enhancements to my 
        <strong>ABCU Advising Assistant</strong> project, showcasing development across:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Software Engineering and Design</li>
        <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
        <li>Database Design and Data Persistence</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The portfolio includes a professional self-assessment, an informal code 
        review, and detailed documentation of each enhancement aligned with 
        Computer Science program outcomes.
