  <h2>ABCU Advising Assistant</h2>

  <p>
    The ABCU Advising Assistant is a console-based advising tool designed to load course data and
    support two primary actions: (1) displaying a sorted list of courses and (2) retrieving details
    and prerequisites for a selected course. This artifact is used across all three capstone enhancement
    categories to demonstrate progression in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and
    database design.
  </p>

  <h3>Original Version</h3>

  <p>
    The artifact I selected is a C++ advising assistance program originally created during an earlier course
    in the Computer Science program. The program reads course data from a CSV file, stores it in memory,
    and allows a user to request a sorted list of classes or input a specific class to view its information
    and prerequisites.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the original program produced correct output, it focused primarily on functionality rather than
    structure. Responsibilities were not clearly separated, inline comments were overly detailed in some
    areas, and the design did not reflect layered organization. This version serves as the baseline
    comparison point for the enhancements below.
  </p>

  <h3>System Flow Diagram</h3>

  <p>
    The diagram below illustrates the overall control flow of the original program, including file loading,
    validation checks, menu navigation, and user interaction pathways.

  <h3>Enhancement 1 – Software Engineering</h3>

  <p>
    This enhancement focuses on improving maintainability, structure, and reliability through stronger
    software engineering practices. I selected this artifact because it provided a clear opportunity to
    redesign an existing solution and demonstrate growth beyond simply producing functional output.
  </p>

  <p>
    The original version lacked separation of concerns. With this enhancement, I restructured the program
    to follow a layered design, separating the data layer, logic layer, and presentation layer. I converted
    course data into an encapsulated class, modified the hash table logic to be UI-agnostic, and implemented
    structured exception handling. These changes made the code easier to follow, test, and extend while
    improving robustness.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the biggest lessons I learned during this process was the importance of separating logic from
    user interface code. By removing console output from the logic layer and using exception-based error
    handling, the system became more modular and easier to maintain. A challenge I faced was introducing
    structural changes without breaking existing functionality. Implementing validation and structured
    error handling required careful planning to prevent crashes and preserve behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    This enhancement demonstrates progress toward professional-level software engineering practices and aligns
    with course outcomes related to designing maintainable computing solutions and applying defensive programming
    techniques.

  <h3>Enhancement 2 – Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h3>

  <p>
    This enhancement focuses on algorithmic reasoning and deeper data structure implementation. I selected
    this artifact for this category because it provided a strong foundation for demonstrating algorithmic
    thinking beyond standard library usage.
  </p>

  <p>
    The earlier version relied on unordered_map to store course data. For this enhancement, I replaced it with
    a manually implemented hash table using array-based indexing and linked-list chaining. I designed a custom
    hash function, implemented collision handling through chaining, and controlled traversal during search
    operations. These changes made time-complexity trade-offs, memory considerations, and collision strategies
    more visible and intentional.
  </p>

  <p>
    A major lesson from this enhancement was understanding the trade-offs between abstraction and control.
    Implementing the hash table manually required careful reasoning about table sizing, hashing distribution,
    and pointer management. One challenge was managing linked lists and dynamic memory without introducing
    instability. Designing and testing the hash function to ensure reasonable performance under collisions
    required structured experimentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This enhancement demonstrates growth from using data structures to designing them. It aligns with course
    outcomes focused on designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles while managing
    design trade-offs.

  <h3>Enhancement 3 – Databases</h3>

  <p>
    This enhancement introduces structured data persistence by transitioning the artifact from purely file-based
    loading to a database-driven approach using SQLite. I selected this artifact for the databases category
    because it allowed me to evolve an existing system into a more realistic data-driven design.
  </p>

  <p>
    The original implementation relied entirely on in-memory data loaded from a CSV file. This enhancement applies
    database principles such as persistence, separation of concerns, and structured data modeling. I separated
    storage responsibilities from application logic, designed structured records that mirror database-style entities,
    and implemented controlled access patterns for reading and managing stored course data.
  </p>

  <p>
    One challenge in this enhancement was adapting a program that was not originally designed for persistence
    without introducing unnecessary complexity or breaking functionality. This process emphasized the importance
    of carefully planning data structures, validating stored data, and maintaining clear boundaries between the
    database layer and the rest of the application.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this enhancement, I strengthened my understanding of how data-layer decisions impact reliability,
    maintainability, and scalability. It aligns with course outcomes related to implementing computing solutions
    using appropriate tools and designing structured, maintainable systems.
