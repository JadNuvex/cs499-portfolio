  <h2>ABCU Advising Assistant</h2>

  <p>
    The ABCU Advising Assistant is a console-based advising tool designed to load course data and
    support two primary actions: (1) displaying a sorted list of courses and (2) retrieving details
    and prerequisites for a selected course. This artifact is used across all three capstone enhancement
    categories to demonstrate progression in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and
    database design.

  <h3>Original Version</h3>
  <p>
    The original implementation focuses on baseline program functionality: loading course data from a CSV file,
    storing course records in memory, and allowing the user to view courses and prerequisites through a
    menu-driven interface. This version serves as the comparison point for the enhancements below.

  <h3>Enhancement 1 – Software Engineering</h3>
  <p>
    This enhancement improves maintainability and structure by refactoring the program toward a cleaner design.
    Responsibilities are separated more clearly between data handling, program logic, and user interaction,
    reducing coupling and making the code easier to test and extend. Defensive programming and structured error
    handling were also emphasized to improve reliability.

  <h3>Enhancement 2 – Algorithms &amp; Data Structures</h3>
  <p>
    This enhancement focuses on algorithmic reasoning and data structure implementation by replacing higher-level
    containers with a manually implemented hash table. The update demonstrates hashing strategy, collision handling
    using chaining, and controlled traversal during search operations. This version highlights performance awareness
    and trade-offs between abstraction and low-level control.

  <h3>Enhancement 3 – Databases</h3>
  <p>
    This enhancement introduces database-driven persistence by transitioning the artifact away from purely file-based
    loading toward structured storage and retrieval using SQLite. It demonstrates data persistence, controlled access
    patterns, and cleaner separation between application logic and the storage layer. This version reflects how storage
    decisions influence reliability, maintainability, and future scalability.
